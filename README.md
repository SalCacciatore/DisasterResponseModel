# Disaster Response Model

This model is designed to classify messages sent in disaster situations.

It is trained on real world events sent during disaster events and can then take a new message as an input and predict the category of message.



## Instructions

Before running the code, make sure you have installed plotly.express, WordCLoud and ligthgbm.

***1. Clean data***

Run the following code:

*python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db*

This runs the "process_data" notebook, takes the "disaster_messages" and 'disaster_categories" files, cleans the data and assigns them to "DisasterResponse".

***2. Train model***

Run the following code:

*python train_classifier.py DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl*

This takes the data from "DisasterResponse" to train the model store in the "classifier" file.

***3. Run the app***

Run the following code:

*python run.py*

***4. Use the app***

In your web browser, go to the app. Then, input a message, click "Classify Message" and then you can see the result.
